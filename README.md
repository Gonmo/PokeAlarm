PokeAlarm is a third party extension of [PokemonGo-Map](https://github.com/PokemonGoMap/PokemonGo-Map) that allows you to receive external notifications via one or more message services.  Customized notifications are available by configuring the `alarms.json` file.

This is a beta branch for v3 of PokeAlarm. As such, it may contain significant changes that aren't reflected in the wiki.
